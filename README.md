## Google Service Account Setup

To use this tool, you need to set up a Google Service Account with access to Google Sheets and Drive APIs:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - Open your web browser and go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Create a new Google Cloud project (e.g., name it "GoogleSheetsMCP")

2. **Enable Required APIs**
   - In the Google Cloud Console, click the Navigation Menu (â˜°) in the top-left corner
   - Go to APIs & Services > Library
   - Search for and enable the following APIs:
     - Google Sheets API
     - Google Drive API

3. **Create a Service Account**
   - From the Navigation Menu, go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
   - Click + Create Service Account at the top
   - Fill in:
     - Service account name: Choose a name (e.g., "sheets-mcp-service")
