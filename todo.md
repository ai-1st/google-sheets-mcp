- [ ] Create test for error handling during sharing
- [ ] Verify tests fail as expected (since implementation is pending)

### Step 11: Implement Spreadsheet Sharing
- [ ] Implement function to share spreadsheet with provided email
- [ ] Set appropriate permissions (writer by default)
- [ ] Add error handling for sharing API calls
- [ ] Run tests to verify implementation works correctly

### Step 12: Enhance Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- [ ] Implement logging system
- [ ] Create helpful error messages for each potential failure point
- [ ] Implement backoff decorator for API calls to handle rate limiting
- [ ] Test error handling with various edge cases
- [ ] Verify logs provide useful information

## Phase 4: Testing and Documentation

### Step 13: Integration Testing
- [ ] Create integration test file
- [ ] Implement test for end-to-end workflow
- [ ] Test various input parameter combinations
- [ ] Verify actual Google Sheets API responses
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] Document any issues found during integration testing

### Step 14: Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Update README with detailed installation instructions
- [ ] Add step-by-step guide for setting up Google API credentials
- [ ] Create examples section with various input combinations
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
- [ ] Create separate examples directory with sample scripts
- [ ] Document API responses and error codes
- [ ] Add comments and docstrings throughout the code

### Step 15: Optimization and Refinement
