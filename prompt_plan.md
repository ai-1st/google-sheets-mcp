# Google Sheet MCP Tool Implementation Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step approach to building a Google Sheets MCP Tool that allows AI assistants to create and manipulate Google Sheets via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Project Overview

Build an MCP server that exposes a tool for creating Google Sheets with specified:
- Title
- Data (as lists of lists)
- Formulas
- Sharing permissions
- Returns the URL of the created sheet

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow test-driven development principles and break down the work into small, incremental steps. Each step will build on the previous one, ensuring no hanging or orphaned code.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Functionality

#### Step 1: Project Structure and Initial Setup

```
Create the basic file structure for the Google Sheets MCP tool. Set up a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and create placeholder files.

1. Create a new directory for the project if it doesn't exist
2. Set up a Python virtual environment
3. Install required packages: fastmcp, gspread, and oauth2client
4. Create a requirements.txt file with all dependencies
5. Initialize a basic README.md explaining the project
6. Set up a test directory
7. Create a placeholder for the main MCP server file

The file structure should look like:
- google_sheets_mcp/
  - requirements.txt
  - README.md
  - gsheets_mcp.py (main server file)
  - tests/
    - test_gsheets_mcp.py
  - google_creds.json (this will be created later)

Let me know when this setup is complete so we can move to implementing the core functionality.
```

#### Step 2: Create Basic MCP Server Structure

```
Let's implement the basic structure of our MCP server using FastMCP. We'll create the skeleton of our server without implementing the actual Google Sheets functionality yet.

In gsheets_mcp.py, implement:

1. Import the necessary libraries (fastmcp, json)
2. Create a FastMCP server instance with a descriptive name
3. Define an empty tool function with the correct signature but returning a dummy response
4. Add a main block to run the server when executed directly

Make the server accept the input structure as defined in the spec:
- title (required)
- data (required)
- formulas (optional)
- share_with (optional)

And return a dummy response structure with:
- status
- message
- url (dummy value for now)

This step ensures our MCP server structure is correct before implementing the actual Google Sheets functionality.
```

#### Step 3: Create Tests for Input Validation

```
Let's create tests for input validation to ensure our tool properly validates the required parameters and their formats.

In tests/test_gsheets_mcp.py, implement tests that:

1. Test that the tool requires 'title' parameter
2. Test that the tool requires 'data' parameter
3. Test that 'data' parameter must be a list of lists
4. Test that the tool accepts 'formulas' and 'share_with' parameters as optional
5. Test that 'formulas' must be a dictionary if provided
6. Test that 'share_with' must be a string if provided

These tests will ensure our validation logic works correctly before proceeding with actual Google Sheets integration.
```

#### Step 4: Implement Input Validation

```
Now let's implement the input validation for our tool based on the tests we've created.

Update the tool function in gsheets_mcp.py to:

1. Validate that 'title' is provided and is a string
2. Validate that 'data' is provided and is a list of lists
3. Validate that 'formulas' is a dictionary if provided
4. Validate that 'share_with' is a string if provided
5. Return appropriate error responses when validation fails

This step ensures our tool will properly validate inputs before attempting to create a Google Sheet.
```

### Phase 2: Google Sheets Integration

#### Step 5: Set Up Google Sheets Authentication

```
Let's set up the authentication with Google Sheets API. We'll need to:

1. Create a helper function to initialize the gspread client with service account credentials
2. Ensure the credentials can be loaded from the expected location
3. Add error handling for authentication issues
4. Update the README with instructions on how to obtain and set up Google API credentials

This step gives us the ability to authenticate with Google Sheets API, which is a prerequisite for creating and manipulating sheets.
```

#### Step 6: Implement Test for Create Spreadsheet Functionality

```
Let's create tests for the core spreadsheet creation functionality.

In tests/test_gsheets_mcp.py, add tests that:

1. Test creating a spreadsheet with a valid title
2. Test adding data to the created spreadsheet
3. Mock the Google Sheets API calls to avoid making actual API calls during testing

These tests will ensure our core functionality works correctly before we implement the actual API integration.
```

#### Step 7: Implement Spreadsheet Creation and Data Population

```
Now let's implement the core functionality to create a spreadsheet and populate it with data.

Update the tool function in gsheets_mcp.py to:

1. Use the gspread client to create a new spreadsheet with the provided title
2. Get the first worksheet of the created spreadsheet
3. Update the worksheet with the provided data
4. Return the spreadsheet URL in the response

This step gives us the ability to create a new Google Sheet and populate it with data, which is the core functionality of our tool.
```

#### Step 8: Implement Tests for Formula Application

```
Let's create tests for applying formulas to cells in the spreadsheet.

In tests/test_gsheets_mcp.py, add tests that:

1. Test applying a single formula to a cell
2. Test applying multiple formulas to different cells
3. Test handling of invalid formula formats

These tests will ensure our formula application functionality works correctly.
```

#### Step 9: Implement Formula Application

```
Now let's implement the functionality to apply formulas to cells in the spreadsheet.

Update the tool function in gsheets_mcp.py to:

1. Check if 'formulas' is provided in the input
2. For each formula, convert the A1 notation to row and column indices
3. Update the cells with the formula strings
4. Handle any errors that might occur during formula application

This step gives us the ability to apply formulas to specific cells in the spreadsheet.
```

### Phase 3: Additional Features and Error Handling

#### Step 10: Implement Tests for Sharing Functionality

```
Let's create tests for sharing the spreadsheet with other users.

In tests/test_gsheets_mcp.py, add tests that:

1. Test sharing the spreadsheet with a valid email address
2. Test handling of invalid email formats
3. Mock the sharing API calls to avoid making actual API calls during testing

These tests will ensure our sharing functionality works correctly.
```

#### Step 11: Implement Spreadsheet Sharing

```
Now let's implement the functionality to share the spreadsheet with other users.

Update the tool function in gsheets_mcp.py to:

1. Check if 'share_with' is provided in the input
2. Share the spreadsheet with the provided email address, granting writer permissions
3. Handle any errors that might occur during sharing

This step gives us the ability to share the created spreadsheet with other users.
```

#### Step 12: Enhance Error Handling and Logging

```
Let's enhance the error handling and add logging to our tool.

Update the gsheets_mcp.py to:

1. Add comprehensive error handling for all Google Sheets API calls
2. Implement logging to capture errors and important events
3. Return helpful error messages in the response when things go wrong
4. Use the backoff decorator for API calls to handle rate limiting

This step improves the robustness of our tool by properly handling errors and providing useful feedback.
```

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation

#### Step 13: Integration Testing

```
Let's create integration tests that verify the end-to-end functionality of our tool.

Create a new file tests/test_integration.py that:

1. Tests the entire workflow from creating a spreadsheet to sharing it
2. Tests various combinations of input parameters
3. Verifies the actual Google Sheets API responses

These tests will ensure our tool works correctly as a whole.
```

#### Step 14: Documentation and Examples

```
Let's enhance the documentation and provide examples of how to use our tool.

Update the README.md to include:

1. Detailed installation instructions
2. Step-by-step guide on how to set up Google API credentials
3. Examples of how to use the tool with various input combinations
4. Troubleshooting tips for common issues

Create a separate examples directory with sample scripts showing how to use the tool in different scenarios.

This step ensures users can easily understand and use our tool.
```

#### Step 15: Optimization and Refinement

```
Let's optimize and refine our implementation based on testing results.

Review the implementation and:

1. Identify any performance bottlenecks
2. Refactor code for better readability and maintainability
3. Add comments and docstrings to improve code documentation
4. Ensure consistent coding style throughout the project

This step improves the quality and performance of our implementation.
```

### Phase 5: Final Touches and Deployment

#### Step 16: Package the Tool for Distribution

```
Let's package our tool for easy distribution and installation.

Create setup files that:

1. Define package metadata
2. List dependencies
3. Include installation scripts
4. Provide entry points for command-line usage

This step makes it easy to distribute and install our tool.
```

#### Step 17: Create a Demo Script

```
Let's create a demo script that showcases the features of our tool.

Create a demo.py file that:

1. Creates a sample spreadsheet with various data types
2. Applies different formulas
3. Shares the spreadsheet with a sample email
4. Displays the result URL

This step provides a clear demonstration of our tool's capabilities.
```

#### Step 18: Final Review and Testing

```
Let's perform a final review and testing of our implementation.

Review the entire codebase and:

1. Run all tests to ensure everything works as expected
2. Verify that all requirements from the specification are met
3. Check for any potential security issues
4. Ensure the code follows best practices and standards

This step ensures our implementation is of high quality and meets all requirements.
